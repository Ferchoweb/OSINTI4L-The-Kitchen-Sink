## Welcome to The Kitchen Sink!
This is a repository of resources and tools for performing Open Source Intelligence Investigations. I have created what I beleive to be a toolkit of OSINT essentials (OSINTials). The toolkit is sourced from resources from all corners of the internet; IntelTechniques, r/osint, and many others to name a few. If you're looking for that, it can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/OSINTials.md). If you are looking for the masterlists dump (a collection of OSINT tool masterlists), you can find that over [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Masterlists.md).

## Bookmarks
I have added bookmarks for your conveniance for both the OSINTials toolkit as well as a specific set for Tor Hidden Services resources. The OSINTials set can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Bookmarks/OSINTialBookmarks.html). **AFTER** reading the [TorHiddenServices section](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/OSINTials.md#tor-hidden-services) of the OSINTials toolkit (for an understanding of the context of this part of the toolkit), you can find the TorHiddenServices bookmarks [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Bookmarks/TorHiddenServicesBookmarks.html).

This repo is constantly updated with new tools, information, and resources, including The Kitchen Sink. Stay a while.
