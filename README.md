## Welcome to The Kitchen Sink!
This is a repository of resources and tools for performing Open Source Intelligence Investigations. I have created what I beleive to be a toolkit of OSINT essentials (OSINTials). The toolkit is sourced from resources from all corners of the internet; IntelTechniques, r/osint, and many others to name a few. If you're looking for that, it can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/OSINTials.md). If you are looking for the masterlists dump (a collection of OSINT tool masterlists), you can find that over [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Masterlists.md).

This repo is constantly updated with new tools, information, and resources, including The Kitchen Sink. Stay a while.
