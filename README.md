## Welcome to The Kitchen Sink!
Here you will find toolkits, learning, and practice resources for Open-Source Intelligence investigations. These resources have beeng gathered from all corners of the internet. There are a ton of resources at your disposal **INCLUDING THE KITCHEN SINK**. The Kitchen Sink is constantly being updated and refined with new tools, information, and resources.

## OSINTials
I have created a toolkit of OSINT essentials (OSINTials) to help you during your investigations and research. The toolkit is pieced together from various toolkits and resources. If you're looking for that, it can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/OSINTials.md). If you're interested in a corresponding set of bookmarks, they can be found [here](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Bookmarks/OSINTialBookmarks.html). This toolkit (as well as the bookmarks) will be updated regularly.

## Masterlists
I have a created a masterlists section where various OSINT toolkits and resources can be found known as [The Dump](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Masterlists.md). If you're looking for a particular toolkit or want to expand your own you might check over there.

## Want to learn?
Many people interested in Open-Source Intelligence are unsure where to begin, the amount of resources and knowledge can be overwhelming. Becaues of this I have a made a section for resources to help get you started developing your OSINT skillset. This section is known as [The Library](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Learn.md), check it out to help you learn a few tricks of the trade.

## The Wiki
In addition to the learning resources found in The Library I have [created a wiki](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/wiki) where you can find detailed walk-throughs and write-ups of various OSINT techniques.

## Where do I practice?
Once you've started researching and developing your OSINT skillset you'll want to refine it. [The Training Arena](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/Practice.md) was created with this in mind. Here you'll find a list of resources and challenges for you to practice your OSINT skillset, give it a look!

## Data Broker Removal Guides
If you would like to remove yourself from certain OSINT/data broker databases, I have added a small list of [Data Removal Guides](https://github.com/OSINTI4L/The-Kitchen-Sink/blob/main/DataBrokerRemoval.md) to teach you how to do just that.

Thanks for checking out The Kitchen Sink, stay a while!
